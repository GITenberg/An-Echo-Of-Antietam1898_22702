description: Though the Civil War short story ""An Echo of Antietam"" marks a notable
  departure from the utopian fantasy that helped author Edward Bellamy rise to literary
  acclaim, it highlights similar themes of community and solidarity. In the tale,
  a young man signs up to fight for the Union forces. Though he is initially ambivalent
  about this decision, he ultimately comes to appreciate the virtue of sacrificing
  oneself to a just cause.
